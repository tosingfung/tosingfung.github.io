<p>Let’s face it: we don’t have a working software specifically designed to make publication-ready plasmid maps. Snapgene is a versatile sequence annotation and manipulation software. But even using the maximal zoom, you end up with a plasmid map with tiny fonts. Illustrator is a super powerful tool to generate vector images. But to draw a solid-filled arrow, you need at least 5 steps. Besides, opening AI takes a while in slow machines, where it also freezes or crashes now and then. All I want is an easy and quick way to draw simple plasmid maps, much like the classical ones included in the manuals of clontech plasmids.</p>

<p>It turns out that the answer is right under our noses. Powerpoint. What else can it be? After spending several hours to make a simple template, any new plasmid map can be put together in 5-10 minutes, with custom annotations including features, restriction sites and primers. As for the color scheme, you can use the gray scale theme similar to  the clontech example above, or adopt the snapgene palette using eyedropper tool. One limitation is that there is no straight forward way to export png with transparent background using Powerpoint. But in most scenarios you simply want to paste the plasmid map to another PPT or TIF.</p>
