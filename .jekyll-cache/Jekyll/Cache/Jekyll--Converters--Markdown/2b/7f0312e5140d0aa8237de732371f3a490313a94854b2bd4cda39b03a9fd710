<h2 id="capsaicin--the-hot-compound-in-chili-peppers">Capsaicin ‚Äì the ‚ÄúHot‚Äù Compound in Chili Peppers</h2>

<p>Do you like spicy food? The most used spice worldwide is the Chili peppers. Although hot and delicious for some, the pungency is originally intended to protect the plant from mammals and fungal infection. The secondary metabolite accounting for the burning effect is a vanilloid compound called capsaicin, which stimulates the noxiceptors on the sensory neurons and produces the pain sensation. Recently, the receptor for capsaicin - TRPV1, is identified and cloned. Because of its important role in nociception and immune response, capsaicin has itself become a ‚ÄúHOT‚Äù topic in biochemical and medical research.</p>

<h2 id="the-hot-plant--chili-peppers">The ‚ÄúHot‚Äù Plant ‚Äì Chili peppers</h2>

<p>Chili peppers originates in Mexico and were consumed by native Americans ever since 7500BC. Archaeological findings show that domestication of chili peppers dates back to 6000BC in southwestern Ecuador. Christopher Columbus introduced chili peppers to the Europe and from then on, chilies were traded and cultivated around the world.</p>

<p>Besides the well-known use in spicy culinary dishes, chili peppers had also been used in traditional medicine for a long time. In some culture, diseases such as tonsillitis, sore throat, cholera, gout, abdominal pains, cholera and ulcers were treated with chili extracts. In addition, chili preparation have been used as antiseptics to prevent parasitic infections.</p>

<p>Chili pepper is fruit of the plants from genus Capsicum, members of the nightshade family, Solanaceae. Common cultivated species include: C. annum (including the famous Mexican Jalapeno), C. frutescens (used in the Tabasco sauce), C. chinense (hottest chili in the world ‚Äì Naga Jolokia pepper). The pungent taste in all chili peppers is produced by a secondary metabolite ‚Äì capsaicin.</p>

<h2 id="capsaicin--biosynthesis-and-hotness">Capsaicin ‚Äì Biosynthesis and ‚ÄúHotness‚Äù</h2>

<p>Capsaicin was first isolated in 1816 by P.A. Bucholz. The Hungarian physician Endre Hogyes proved that besides causing the burning feeling when in contact with skin or mucous membrane, capsaicin also increased the secretion of gastric acid. Structure of capsaicin was partially elucidated by Nelson in 1919 and in 1955. Crombie first reported the artificial synthesis of capsaicin.</p>

<h4 id="the-chemical-structure-of-capsaicin-and-vanillin">The chemical structure of capsaicin and vanillin</h4>

<p>Capsaicin is synthesized from vanillin (right), the primary component in the extract of vanilla bean. Vanillin is a secondary metabolite belonging to the phenolic compounds. The carbon backbone is derived from amino acid phenylalanine, which is synthesized via the shikimic acid pathway from simple carbohydrate precursors from glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway. The enzyme phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) removes ammonia to form trans-Cinnamic acid. Final cleavage of a two-carbon fragment from the side chain and further modification result in vanillin, a benzoic acid derivatives.</p>

<p><img src="/images/cap-2.png" alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="the-biosynthetic-pathway-of-capsaicin">The biosynthetic pathway of capsaicin</h4>

<p>The vanillin is then converted to vanillylamine (left moiety) by reducing the side chain ketone group into the amine. Finally the enzyme acyltransferase, encoded by the gene AT3, catalyzes addition of a branched-chain fatty acid (right moiety) to vanillylamine and form capsaicin. Thus, capsaicin is a fatty amide derivative of the phenolic compound vanillin.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the structure of the fatty acid moiety can strongly affect the relative ‚Äúhotness‚Äù of capsaicin and its related compounds (referred to as capsaicinoids). Capsaicin accounts for 69% of total capsaicinoids in chili peppers and has the strongest pungency. Dihydrocapsaicin (22% of total capsaicinoid) has the same carbon skeleton, but is saturated in the fatty acid moiety. It has about the same pungency as capsaicin. But for homocapsaicin, which accounts for only 1% of total capsaicinoid and has one more carbon in the fatty acid moiety, is only half as pungent as capsaicin.</p>

<p><img src="/images/cap-3.png" alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="the-structure-of-dihydrocapsaicin-and-homocapsaicin">The structure of dihydrocapsaicin and homocapsaicin</h4>

<p>You may wonder: how can the relative pungency of capsaicinoids be determined? In fact, chili peppers are so popular that an American chemist called Wilbur Scoville developed a scale for rating the pungency. This method is called Scoville Organoleptic Test. Basically, the sample (a capsaicinoid solution or pepper extract) is diluted in sugar syrup until the pungency is no longer detectable to tasters. The dilution factor is termed Scoville units (SU) for the sample. For example, sweet pepper that contains no capsaicin at all has SU equals to zero, meaning that no pungency is detectable even when it is undiluted. On the other extreme, pure capsaicin has SU of 15,000,000 or higher, meaning that it has to be diluted 15 million times before the pungency is undetectable.</p>

<h2 id="hot-for-a-living--natural-function-of-capsaicin">‚ÄúHot‚Äù for a Living ‚Äì Natural Function of Capsaicin</h2>

<p>Although it makes a good dish, chili peppers evolved to be spicy apparently not for that reason. An educative guess for the natural function of capsaicin is to deter herbivores. But plants produce fruits to attract animal and disperse seeds. What is the rationale for making a spicy fruit like chili peppers, which nevertheless look colorful and attractive?</p>

<p>The fact is, ‚Äúone‚Äôs poison is another‚Äôs delicacy‚Äù. Scientists found that though capsaicin is an irritant for mammals, birds seem unaffected at all. Actually the seeds of chili peppers are predominantly dispersed by birds in nature. The seeds consumed by birds pass through the digestive tract and are able to germinate afterwards. On the other hand, seeds are destroyed by the molars present in most mammals, and thus cannot germinate once eaten by mammals. So we see here an adaptation for chili peppers to increase the synthesis of capsaicin, which protects them selectively from mammalian herbivores.</p>

<p>But the story doesn‚Äôt end there. For chili peppers, the most significant predisposal fruit and seed damage is not due to mammals or insects, but infection by a fungal species called Fusarium semitectum. The fungus gains entry into the pepper fruits with the help of hemipteran bettles (Figure 1a), which pierce the pericarp of fruits with their proboscises. The invasion leaves visible scars on the fruit surface. (Figure 1b) Inside, fungal propagation causes decomposition of the fresh and seeds (Figure 1c) The degree of damage can be scored by the discoloration of the fruit.</p>

<p><img src="/images/cap-4.png" alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="figure-1-a-the-hemipteran-beetle-b-visible-bitten-scars-on-the-fruit-c-relationship-between-fungal-propagation-and-seed-viability"><strong>Figure 1</strong>. a, The hemipteran beetle. b, visible bitten scars on the fruit. c, relationship between fungal propagation and seed viability</h4>

<p>In 2006, a research group found that although both pungent and non-pungent chili peppers suffer from Fusarium infection, pungent fruits are generally more resistant. Also, under the same level of hemipteran foraging pressure, non-pungent fruits have more than twice higher seed infection rate compared with pungent fruits. This observations indicate a potential anti-fungal role for capsaicin in chili peppers.</p>

<p>To confirm this, the scientists did an in vitro experiment. They prepared artificial fruit media that mimic the composition of chili peppers and used them to culture Fusarium. In the present of capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin, the relative fungal growth (related to the control medium that doesn‚Äôt contain capsaicinoid) is measured. As shown in Figure 2, the growth of Fusarium is significantly inhibited by capsaicin as well as dihydrocapsaicin. If capsaicin is an adaptation evolved to defend against fungal infection, we would expect to find the content of capsaicin to correlate with the fungal selection pressure.</p>

<p><img src="/images/cap-5.png" alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="figure-2-the-relative-growth-of-fusarium-under-different-concentrations-of-capsaicin-solid-line-and-dihydrocapsaicin-dashed-line-figure-reproduced-from-joshua-2008"><strong>Figure 2</strong>. The relative growth of Fusarium under different concentrations of capsaicin (solid line) and dihydrocapsaicin (dashed line). Figure reproduced from Joshua, 2008</h4>

<p>This is in fact what the scientists found in seven chili populations in eastern Bolivia. They discovered that the capsaicin content in chili peppers is directly proportional to the number of hemipteran scars on the fruit, which indicates degree of fungal infection. This is an interesting finding showing that the chemistry of wild plants can be shaped by microbes. But the mechanism by which infection induces capsaicin synthesis awaits further study.</p>

<h2 id="hot-receptor--the-capsaicin-receptor">‚ÄúHot‚Äù Receptor ‚Äì The Capsaicin Receptor</h2>

<p>Can you tell the difference between spicy and hot with your tongue? Probably you can‚Äôt. Because the taste of pungency and high temperature share the same receptor. Despite the long history in food and medicine, the molecular target of capsaicin was not identified until 1997 in UCSF. It was called the vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (VR1), but it is now more commonly known as: transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily V, member 1 (TRPV1). Structurally, TRPV1 is a ligand-gated ion channel composed of six transmembrane segments, with both its C- and N-terminal on the cytosolic side. A short and hydrophobic region between helix 5 and 6 accounts for the pore forming site. The homomeric interaction of four TRPV1 combine to form a functional tetramer.</p>

<p>TRPV1 can be activated by a variety of stimuli. Exogenous chemical ligands, such as capsaicin and a daphnane diterpene called resiniferatoxin, can bind to the ligand binding site on the cytosolic side and trigger channel opening. Also, physical stimuli like low pH (~pH 5.5) and heat (~ 45oC) can activate TRPV1.</p>

<p>TRPV1 is a non-selective cation channel, meaning that most cations can pass through it down the electrochemical gradient. Since the most abundant extracellular cation is Na+ and Ca2+, opening of TRPV1 causes to influx of Na+ and Ca2+, leading to depolarization of the plasma membrane of the sensory neuron bearing it.</p>

<p>Since capsaicin is an exogenous compound to our body, what is the physiological role of TRPV1? (Seriously we didn‚Äôt evolve a receptor just to enjoy spicy food.) Recently in its phase I clinical trial, the compound AMG 517, a TRPV1-selective antagonist, was shown to cause hyperthermia (38.8oC) in healthy subjects. And in as early as 1878, capsaicin was reported to cause hypothermia in a dog after intragastric administration of pepper extract.</p>

<p>The fact that TRPV1 agonists cause hypothermia and antagonists cause hyperthermia suggests a role in body temperature maintenance. It was proposed that TRPV1 is tonically active and regulate body temperature by affecting vasodilation/vasoconstriction and the metabolic rate. Since the hypothalamus is important in maintaining homeostasis, the site for TRPV1 thermoregulation was initially predicted to locate there.</p>

<p>However in a recent study, various artificial TRPV1 antagonists were synthesized. They were conjugated with hydrophilic moiety and thus peripherally restricted (cannot pass the blood brain barrier). When these compounds were tested on animal models, they caused hyperthermia as well as their brain-acting counterparts. Later it was confirmed that the thermoregulation is carried out by tonically active TRPV1 channels in visceral organs.</p>

<p>This explains why people living in hot climate enjoy spicy food more than those living in cold climate: although capsaicin causes burning hot sensation in the mouth and tongue, it also has a general hypothermal effect and makes them feel cooler as a whole.</p>

<h2 id="hot-in-action--molecular-basis-of-capsaicin-induced-pain">‚ÄúHot‚Äù in action ‚Äì Molecular Basis of Capsaicin Induced Pain</h2>

<p>Although capsaicin has hypothermal activity, it is quite unlikely that plants utilize this property for self-defense. Obviously it is neither effective nor quick enough. To serve as an good food deterrent, a compound must cause extensive damage to the herbivore within short period of time. Capsaicin accomplishes this via two pathways, which occur independently but also amplify each other. TRPV1 is located on the nerve terminal of some primary sensory neurons, whose somata are in the dorsal root ganglion. These neurons are peptidergic and use substance P (SP) as the major neurotransmitter.</p>

<p><img src="/images/cap-6.png" alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="figure-3-mechanism-of-capsaicin-induced-pain-figure-reproduced-from-aprad-1999"><strong>Figure 3</strong>. Mechanism of capsaicin-induced pain. Figure reproduced from Aprad, 1999</h4>

<p>On one hand, activation of TRPV1 leads to depolarization of the sensory neurons. The action potential propagates via the axon and is passed on to the secondary-order neurons in the spinal cord. The signal travels upwards and finally reaches the brain‚Äôs nocicenter and causes the pain sensation. This takes only a few milliseconds upon capsaicin binding to TRPV1.</p>

<p>On the other hand, stimulation of the nerve terminal by capsaicin triggers the release of several local neuropeptides, including substance P, neurokinin A and the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). These substances cause local tissue damage and leads to inflammation. For example, SP binds to the receptor NK-1R and cause contraction of the smooth muscle cells and opening of endothelial gaps. SP also stimulates mucus secretion and activates various immune components such as the mast cells. This process is termed neurogenic inflammation and occurs within minutes. The resulting edema, itching and bronchospasm are the irritating reaction associated with pain upon contact with capsaicin.</p>

<p>The interaction between the two pathways further amplify the reaction. The activated mast cells secret histamine, which binds to histamine receptors on the terminal of sensory neurons. This not only intensifies the pain sensation but also triggers the further release of neuropeptides and aggravates the inflammation response. That‚Äôs how capsaicin protects chili peppers from herbivores, and (ironically) how we all become crazy fans of spicy food.</p>

<h2 id="hot-research--therapeutic-and-other-application-of-capsaicin">‚ÄúHot‚Äù Research ‚Äì Therapeutic and Other Application of Capsaicin</h2>

<p>At first glance, it is quite counter-intuitive to use capsaicin as a painkiller ‚Äì wouldn‚Äôt it just make things worse? However, chili pepper extract has been used for centuries as an analgesia. Currently capsaicin is used as topical ointments to relieve the pain of peripheral neuropathy, especially in post-herpetic neuralgia.</p>

<p>The rationale here is ‚Äúto fight fire with fire‚Äù. If high dose of capsaicin is applied to an area, the sensory neurons will be over-stimulated and the release of substance P can not catches up with its synthesis. In this sense, capsaicin depletes the neuron of SP and results in a desensitized state. The patient may first feel intense heat and pain, followed by a long period of numbness. However, there is a catch: prolong stimulation with capsaicin will lead to excessive calcium ion influx and eventually kill the sensory neuron.</p>

<p>To make use of pain chemistry of capsaicin and TRPV1 without causing undesired side effects, scientists are looking for specific TRPV1 antagonists. It was prospected that by inhibiting the nociception, TRPV1 antagonists will serve as a new class of analgesia and thus supplement the use of NSAID and opioid drugs.</p>

<p>Capsaicin also finds applications in many other areas, most of which make use of its hotness. For example, a Harvard Medical School Professor proposed the use of capsaicin as a drug deterrent. Prescribed opioid drugs are commonly abused. By adding capsaicin into the capsule, he reasons, patients taking the drugs as prescribed will not suffer from any ill effect, but drug abusers who ever attempt to chew, crush, snort or inject the drugs will experience intense pain ‚Äìlike ‚Äúsnorting an extract of 50 jalapeno peppers at one go‚Äù.</p>

<p>Also, capsaicin is the major component in the famous pepper spray used in riot control and personal defense. There is even an association called Elephant Pepper Development Trust, which encourage farmers in Africa to grow chili peppers as a barrier crop in order to protect their crops from elephants. Can you even imagine a ‚Äúmisuse‚Äù of capsaicin? I am not talking about people who abuse chili peppers. In the 2008 Beijing Olympics, four horse was tested positive for capsaicin, which is supposed to enhance their performance. The horse were disqualified from the equestrian sports. A hot doping, right?</p>

<h2 id="concluding-remarks">Concluding remarks</h2>

<p>In this article, I have introduced the biosynthesis, mechanisms of action and several applications of capsaicin, the secondary metabolite in chili peppers that makes it pungent. The biochemistry and physiological function of TRPV1, the recently identified receptor for capsaicin, is briefly summarized. I also discussed the two pathways, namely pain sensation and neurogenic inflammation, that accounts for the irritating nature of capsaicin. Due to their important functions in nociception and inflammation, capsaicin and TRPV1 will continue to be a ‚ÄúHOT‚Äù topic in medical and science research.</p>
