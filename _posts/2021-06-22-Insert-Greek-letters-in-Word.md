- Several methods
- Math Autocorrect is the best method

## Insert symbols

This is the most well known method. Go to Insert in the ribbon, select Symbols > Symbol > More Symbols, then choose from the list. Drawback: this method is extremely slow. You also need to locate the Greek characters at the beginning.

## Change font to Symbol

#### Select the letter and change its font to Symbol. Drawback: you need to memorize which English letter correspond to which Greek letter, and some are a bit difficult. For example, `c` is for &#x03C7; (chi) and `x` is for &#x03BE; (xi). Also, there is another fatal drawback: **when you want to change the font of the whole paragraph, every Greek character needs to be converted again.**

## Alter code

#### Keep pressing the `Alt` key, and enter the alter-code in the Num pad, then release the `Alt` key. Drawback: this method requires a full size keyboard, so it is not available for most 14-inch or smaller laptops. Also, you need to memorize the codes.

## Unicode and Alt+X

#### Enter a four letter/digit Unicode (hex), select the code and press `Alt`+`x`. Drawback: this method is a bit slow, and you also need to memorize the codes. Some codes contain letters so they are more difficult to remember compared with alter codes.

#### The Unicode for a character can also be seen when inserting the symbol.

#### Go to Insert in the ribbon, select Symbols > Equation. Greek letters is input with `\` followed by its name. For capital cases, simply do it like this `\Delta`. Drawback: the Greek characters inserted in this way will behave like math equations and they are always italic.

## Math AutoCorrect rules

#### Go to Word Options > Proofing, click open the AutoCorrect Options..., go to Math AutoCorrect tab, check the above selection box. Now, the insert equation method can be used without inserting equation, and the inserted Greek characters behave like normal fonts. **This is by far the best method to insert Greek letters.**

## Chinese input

#### Switch to Chinese input and type the English words for Greek characters. Drawbacks: some less common characters will not appear, especially capital cases.
