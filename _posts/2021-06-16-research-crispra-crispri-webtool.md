## [CRISPick](https://portals.broadinstitute.org/gppx/crispick/public)

Candidate sequences for CRISPRa/i design are selected from specific regions of genomic sequence relative to a gene's transcription start site (TSS) according to the direction of transcription (i.e. strand). The coordinates currently in use are: 

- CRISPRa:   -300 to 0 bases from TSS
- CRISPRi:   -50 to +300 bases from TSS
