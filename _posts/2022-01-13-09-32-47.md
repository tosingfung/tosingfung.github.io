#### 27 fmol of vector is recommended. For 3 kb plasmid, 27 fmol is 50 ng.

## **Vector mass with Snapgene**

#### Press <kbd>Ctrl + Shift + M<kbd>. 1 fmol = 2.68 ng, so 27 fmol = 72.36ng.

## General considerations

- 1:3 Vector:Insert in general
- 1:1 if vector and insert are similar in size
- Increase molar ratio with small inserts
- 1:10 if insert is less than 100 bp
- 1:20 for annealed oligos (~24 bp)
