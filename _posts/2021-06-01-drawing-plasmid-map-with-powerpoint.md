#### pEGFP-C1 map drawn with Powerpoint

<!--more-->

Let's face it: we don't have a working software specifically designed to make publication-ready plasmid maps. Snapgene is a versatile sequence annotation and manipulation software. But even using the maximal zoom, you end up with a plasmid map with tiny fonts. Illustrator is a super powerful tool to generate vector images. But to draw a solid-filled arrow, you need at least 5 steps. Besides, opening AI takes a while in slow machines, where it also freezes or crashes now and then. All I want is an easy and quick way to draw simple plasmid maps, much like the classical ones included in the manuals of clontech plasmids.

It turns out that the answer is right under our noses. Powerpoint. What else can it be? After spending several hours to make a simple template, any new plasmid map can be put together in 5-10 minutes, with custom annotations including features, restriction sites and primers. As for the color scheme, you can use the gray scale theme similar to  the clontech example above, or adopt the snapgene palette using eyedropper tool. One limitation is that there is no straight forward way to export png with transparent background using Powerpoint. But in most scenarios you simply want to paste the plasmid map to another PPT or TIF.

## Step-by-step instruction

#### First, draw the backbone and give it a name. Add a `Block Arc` and `Arrow Circular` for non-directional and directional feature, respectively. You need to do fine adjustment so that the width of the arc and the arrow are the same, and that the backbone runs through their center.

#### Capture the snapgene display and put it at the bottom. Align it so that the snapgene map is co-centric with the backbone we've just drawn.

#### Now make more copies of the arc and arrow and adjust their position so that they represent the features that you would like to show in your plasmid map.

#### Next add the feature labels. Use some narrow and small fonts to save space, but make sure they are clear and legible

#### After adding the restriction sites, you can delete the snapgene map at the bottom. The radiants for the restriction sites should preferable origin from the circle center.

#### Solid fill the backbone white so that only the pointing edges of the radiants are visible

#### Here comes the fun part, you can add color to the final map to make it more attractive. Here I am using the snapgene color scheme.

#### You can also add primer(s) on the outer edge.
