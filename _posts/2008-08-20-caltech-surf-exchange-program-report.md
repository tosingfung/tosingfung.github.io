## The Role of Ubiquitin Proteasome System in the Differentiation of Mouse Embryonic Stem Cell into Cardiomyocyte

## Abstract

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the world. Present treatments are palliative and patients have poor prognosis. Embryonic stem cell (ES cells) therapy is a promising curative therapy. We study how the differentiation of mouse ES cells into cardiomyocytes is regulated by the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS), the major mechanism of extra-lysosomal protein degradation. A reporter ES cell line expressing a green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene regulated by the promoter for α-myosin heavy chain (a cardiomyocyte specific gene) is used. Cells are pre-cultured in Col-IV flasks for four days prior to plating, which has been shown to enhance differentiation and assay homogeneity in the pilot experiment. Plated cells are transfected with a siRNA library targeting genes specific to the UPS. GFP signal is screened every other day starting from Day7. We have identified seven potential UPS genes that down regulates cardiomyocyte specific differentiation of ES cells.

## Background

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the world. Congestive heart failure (CHF) accounts for a significant portion of heart disease and its prevalence increases steeply with age. Current therapies for advanced CHF are palliative. In most cases, patients have poor prognosis and the median survival time is 6 months. Heart transplantation is the only cure, but it’s not available for all patients.

One alternative treatment is the transplantation of isolated cardiomyocytes, which has been shown to restore cardiac function in animal models ( [^1] and [^2] ). However, the use of neonatal cardiomyocytes is not ethical in human therapies. In order to generate enough cell number, an alternative cell source is ES cells, which can differentiate into cells of all three germ layers. Transplantation of cardiomyocytes derived from human ES cells is shown to restore cardiac function of rats [^3]. But in clinical application, a pure cardiomyocyte lineage must be selected before transplanted into human body.

The in vitro differentiation of ES cells into cardiomyocytes is regulated by several signaling pathways [^4]. Inhibitory Wnt signals from the ectoderm and stimulating BMP-2 signals from the endoderm induce mesodermal cells to differentiate into cardiac progenitor cells ( [^5] and [^6] ). Cardiac progenitor cells express cardiac specific transcription factors (such as GATA-4, Nkx-2.5), which induce expression of cardiac specific genes. Differentiated cardiomyocytes are structural and functional specialized cells.

The intracellular concentration and activity of these signaling molecules and/or transcriptional factors are regulated by various mechanisms. Ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) has been identified as the cell’s major mechanism of extra-lysosomal cytosolic and nuclear protein degradation. It is involved in the regulation of many cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, signal transduction, endocytosis and so on [^7]. Target proteins are ubiquitinated by three enzymes: ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (E2), and ubiquitin protein ligase (E3). E1 activates ubiquitin by ATP hydrolysis, E2 transfers activated ubiquitin to E3, and E3 catalyzes covalent linkage of ubiquitin to the protein substrate. Substrate specificity is mainly provided by hundreds of E3 ligase and other associated adaptor proteins. Poly-ubiquitinated proteins are recognized by the 26S proteasome. The 19S regulatory complex deubiquitinates, unfolds and internalizes the substrate, and the 20S catalytic complex exerts proteolytic degradation.

Recent studies show that the UPS is involved in the regulation of pluripotency maintenance and lineage commitment of ES cells ( [^8] and [^9] ). We are interested in how the UPS regulate differentiation of ES cells into cardiomyocytes and design a reporter assay to screen for potential UPS genes.

## ES cell reporter cell line and siRNA screen assay design

A mouse ES cell line expressing a green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene regulated by the promoter for α-myosin heavy chain (α-MHC) is used. α-MHC is a cardiomyocyte specific gene, thus the GFP expression level indicates the degree of cardiomyocyte specific differentiation of ES cells. This ES cell line can be grown on gelatin-coated substrate, and requires no feeder layer.

ES cells are first cultured in leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) containing medium, to maintain pluripotency and generate enough cell number. The cells are then plated on gelatin coated 384-well plates, with initial density of about 5500 cells/well. On day2 post-plating, cells in the control set is mock transfected, and cells in the treatment set is transfected with siRNA. The siRNA library targets about 1000 genes specific to the UPS, including E1, E2, E3 and proteasome genes. The majorities are E3 ligase and associated adaptor proteins. The siRNA library is a pooled library: in each well there are 4 siRNA with different sequence target the same UPS gene. GFP expression level in each well is screened at various time points to quantify the degree of carduomyocyte specific differentiation.

## Optimization of assay condition

Prior to the siRNA screen, culturing conditions for spontaneous differentiation of ES cells need to be established, and a pilot experiment was performed in which cells are plated but not treated with siRNA (control set).  Previous tudies show that preculturing ES cells in Collagen-IV (Col-IV) can enhance differentiation [^10]. Thus the pilot experiment also incorporated two other sets: the Col-IV pre-culture set and the gelatin pre-culture set, in which ES cells were pre-cultured in Col-IV and gelatin respectively for 4 days before plated.

In all the 3 sets of the pilot experiment, cells were plated on 384-well plates as well as slide flasks. The slide flasks were fixed on Day1, Day8 and Day12 post-plating and GFP expression was qualitatively assayed using a fluorescent microscope. The 384-well plates were screened for GFP expression on Day7, Day10 and Day13 post-plating. The images of slide flask pilot experiment is shown as in Table-1. In the control set, no GFP was expressed on Day1 and Day 8. Very low level of GFP was expressed by scattered singlular cells on Day12. 2. In the Col-IV pre-culture set, no GFP was expressed on Day1. Intermediate GFP expression was observed on Day8. On Day12, the GFP intensity was much higher and GFP positive cell areas were extensively distributed on the slide. 3. In the gelatin pre-preculture set, no GFP was expressed on Day1 and Day 8. Intermediate GFP expression was observed on Day12.

As shown in Table-2, the results of 384-well plate experiment were in consistence with the slide flasks experiment. GFP expression was quantified as total GFP positive areas (square μm) in each well.

#### **Table 2.** GFP expression of αMHC-GFP cells in 384-well plate experiment

To further characterize GFP distribution on a plate, a histogram showing the well number count of different GFP expression level was plotted for Day13 data of the two pre-culture sets, as shown in Figure-1. In the gelatin pre-culture set, most wells had GFP expression in the low to intermediate range. In the Col-IV preculture set, GFP expression was naturally distributed in the intermediate to high range.

#### **Figure 1.** Well number count of total GFP positive areas in Col-IV pre-culture Day 13 plates and gelatin pre-culture Day 13 plates

To conclude the pilot experiments, ES cells plated on gelatin coated substrate without pre-culture have very limited cardiomyocyte specific differentiation. Pre-culturing ES cells in gelatin can enhance cardiomyocyte differentiation to a certain degree. Pre-culturing ES cells in Col-IV enhances differentiation into cardiomyocytes significantly, resulting in a high level and homogenous expression of GFP. Thus, Col-IV pre-culture was incorporated into the siRNA screen protocol.

## siRNA screening assay

Based on the pilot experiment, the established culture condition was applicable and thus utilized in the siRNA screen. After 4 day pre-culture in Col-IV, ES cells were plated on twelve 384-well plates. On day2 post-plating, ten plates with most similar cell density were chosen and cells were transfected.

The assay was done duplicated; all wells in Plate 1, 2, 3, 4, 1R, 2R, 3R and 4R were treated with siRNA from the library. Four rows in Plate 5 and 5R were transfected with siRNA, the remaining wells were mock transfected and served as the control. GFP expression was screened on day4, 6, 8, 10, 13 and 15 post-plating. Before day10, GFP expression was insignificant. After day10, cell detachment was observed in some over-confluent wells. Thus, Day10 data was analyzed. Table-3 shows the data analysis of all ten plates and the control set.

#### **Table 3.** GFP expression on ten plates and the control set (square micron)

There was significant variation within a plate, shown by the large standard deviation in all plates and in the non-treated control sets. Two plates, plate 2R and plate 4, had significant larger mean compare to the control sets and other plates. However, this was unlikely caused by siRNA treatment, because it was not observed in the replica: plate 2 and 4R. Thus the high GFP expression was most likely due to high initial cell density in these two plates. All other plates behaved similarly to the control. Thus we can assume that, on any transfected plate, the net effect of siRNA treatment in all wells was close to zero. Thus, the mean value of each plate can be used as an internal standard for its own wells.  Based on this, we established a scheme to score GFP expression in the wells:

| GFP expression of a well                               | Score |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----- |
| Between "mean + SD" and "mean + 2SD" of its own plate  | 1     |
| Between "mean + 2SD" and "mean + 3SD" of its own plate | 2     |
| Above "mean + 3SD" of its own plate                    | 3     |

The possibility of a well being a potential positive hit is given by the sum score in the same well on both a plate (plate#) and its replicate (plate#R):

| Possibility of a well being a positive hit | Sum score (Plate # + Plate # R) |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| High                                       | 6                               |
| Intermediate to high                       | 5                               |
| Intermediate                               | 4                               |
| Low to intermediate                        | 3                               |
| Low                                        | 2                               |

Imposing this scoring scheme on the day10 data, one “intermediate to high” and six “intermediate” hits were identified. Based on preliminary review, these hits corresponded to either E3 ligase or associated adaptor proteins. We still need to analyze data of other time points to confirm the result.

## Validating experiments

To validate the potential positive hits identified in the screen, the corresponding pooled siRNA will be separated into four individual siRNA and re-screen with the cells. Within four wells targeting the same UPS gene, if 3-4 wells are still positive, then the potential positive hit will be confirmed as true hits. However, if 0-2 wells are positive, the potential positive hit will be rejected. The true hits will be further validated with another ES cell reporter cell line, which expresses a luciferase gene regulated by the α-MHC promoter.

## siRNA screening assay limitation and improvement

We discovered some limitations in the siRNA screen assay. First, siRNA transfection is a stress for ES cells. It inhibits ES cells’ proliferation and differentiation. There is no alternative method to deliver the siRNA. To compensate for the stress, GFP screens at early time points (Day4, 6, 8) can be omitted. Thus, the period that cells stay outside the incubator is minimized. Secondly, there is a large inter-plate deviation. Thus, control wells should be introduced into each plate as internal standard. Finally, the effect of siRNA only last for 1-2 days. Thus the assay only screen for genes that act within the 2 days post-transfection. Alternatively, other silencing agent such as shRNA can be used to have a more sustained silencing effect.

## Conclusion

We have established a cell-based siRNA screen assay to identify potential UPS genes that regulate differentiation of ES cells into cardiomyocytes. Pre-culturing ES cells in Col-IV can enhance cardiomyocyte differentiation and assay homogeneity. Seven potential UPS genes (E3 ligases and associated adaptor proteins) are identified. To confirm the result, further data analysis and re-screen are required.
